# AutomatedReservationManager

Automated Reservation Manager is a Java Web Application that allows to manage the state of the tables of a restaurant, allowing the clients either to:
* Reserve a table, by specifying the number of seats, the date and the time.
* Request a table in real time, by specifying the number of seats.

This application is meant to be used with mobile devices too (expecially for the real-time request of a table), and its main purpose is to optimize the usage of the resources (the tables), minimizing the waiting time of the clients, and allowing the client to not physically stand in a queue as they wait for a table to free.
